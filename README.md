Finding the right pace in cycling and running can be hard for many since human body can't recognise the preferred cadence when the activity level changes or the terrain is unusual. Choosing to use a biased cadence in the long term can even be painful for certain groups who suffer from persistent knee pain or muscular stress. Andare aims to solve this problem by bringing cadence calculation to iPhone, agglomerating health-related insights, weather info, and data-driven statistics into a workout app that features the following flow:

* Start a workout from the home screen and a countdown will be initiated, during which the workout is prepared to enter background, and you can turn off the screen safely.
* Live statistics are displayed in the app. A live activity is launched so that you can easily glance over the accurate measure of cadence in the last minute on the lock screen or on your Apple Watch.
* Stop the workout to see the summary. You can also view history summaries in Fitness app.
