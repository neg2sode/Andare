# Andare
Finding the right pace in cycling and running can be hard for many since human body can't recognise the preferred cadence when the activity level changes or the terrain is unusual. Choosing to use a biased cadence in the long term can even be painful for certain groups who suffer from persistent knee pain or muscular stress. Andare aims to solve this problem by bringing cadence calculation to iPhone, agglomerating health-related insights, weather info, and data-driven statistics into a workout app that features the following flow:

* Start a workout from the home screen and a countdown will be initiated, during which the workout is prepared to enter background, and you can turn off the screen safely.
* Live statistics are displayed in the app. A live activity is launched so that you can easily glance over the accurate measure of cadence in the last minute on the lock screen or on your Apple Watch.
* Stop the workout to see the summary. You can also view history summaries in Fitness app.

## About Me
Hey! My name is neg2sode, and I'm an undergraduate student born & raised in Shanghai / studying in London. Aside from being a student, I'm also a passionate mountain biker who also spends time training on the road.

Dealing with knee pain has made me more aware of how critical proper cadence is during cycling, but I didn't want to rely on a physical cadence sensor for my bike, so Andare began as a personal project - born out of necessity and curiosity. After observing people in my community and speaking with my family and friends, I realised many people face similar challenges in maintaining a healthy cadence. So I started building Andare in a way that can benefit not just me, but others as well.

As a student with limited time, money and resources, I decided to share my work with the community and shift focus to adapting it for the Swift Student Challenge. My hope is that it might not only inspire others, but perhaps open a door for me too - like publishing the app eventually.

Thanks for stopping and having a look.
